## frag.jetzt Content Review and User Control Mechanisms

**frag.jetzt** uses modern technologies and automated systems for content review and filtering to detect and block offensive or inappropriate material before it is published.

### 1. Algorithms for Text Recognition

- These systems automatically scan content to detect potential violations of guidelines.

### 2. Manual Moderation

- A team of moderators reviews reported content and takes appropriate actions if necessary.

## Mechanism for Reporting Offensive Content

- **Report Buttons:** Users can flag content via a visible report button within the app or on the website.
- **Quick Response:** Reports are reviewed promptly, and necessary actions are taken to remove or assess the reported content.

## Ability to Block Abusive Users

- **Blocking Function:** Users can block others who behave abusively.
- **Suspension and Exclusion:** frag.jetzt has mechanisms in place to temporarily suspend or permanently remove abusive user accounts.

## Published Contact Information

- **Support Email:** Users are provided with an email address to contact support.
- **Contact Form:** An online form allows users to easily seek help or report issues.

## Main Issue or Potential Problem

A **potential issue** identified during the compliance analysis is the **use of PayPal** for purchasing token contingents (in tiers of 3, 5, 10, and 20 Euros) to access the OpenAI API.

### Concern

- According to the app store guidelines, in-app purchases for digital content or services must go through the **in-app purchase system**. Using PayPal for this purpose could conflict with App Store and Play Store guidelines. This could result in non-compliance if the purchase is linked to accessing digital content or services directly through the app.
