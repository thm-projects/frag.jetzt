# frag.jetzt

Nomen est omen: The app's name says it all: it stands for both the app's main purpose and its web address <https://frag.jetzt>

[![Quality Gate Status](https://scm.thm.de/sonar/api/project_badges/measure?project=de.thm.arsnova%3Afrag-jetzt-frontend&metric=alert_status)](https://scm.thm.de/sonar/dashboard?id=de.thm.arsnova%3Afrag-jetzt-frontend)

## Vision Statement

With our innovative product "frag.jetzt" we want to conquer the market of audience response systems. With "frag.jetzt," we are addressing teachers at schools and universities. With "frag.jetzt," we offer a browser-based, privacy-compliant Q&A app for anonymous, silent questioning. The unique selling point is the option to award "good questions" for earning bonuses. Studies show that active participation in class is significantly boosted by silent questions. Bonuses for good questions as extrinsic learning motivation reinforce this effect.

## Features

1. There are four roles in the app: "room creator", "moderator", "participant" and "administrator". Each role allows the creation of any number of rooms. The moderator role is assigned by the creator of a room to people who have registered. In addition, the moderator role can be temporarily assigned to guests by creating a special room key or link. In each role, questions can be asked anonymously and others' questions can be read. The administrator can write messages and publish them for all users.

1. When creating a room, the room creator can choose whether all questions should be moderated or published directly, whether a profanity filter should be active, whether the quiz app " antworte.jetzt", the bonus option or the brainstorming option should be activated.

1. After entering the room key or by scanning the QR code, participants can ask their questions and rate others' questions with +1 or -1. The question board can be moderated. Room creators or moderators can set a threshold for automatic publication of a question, i.e., at what rating a question is displayed on the question board. The threshold can be set between -100 and 0 rating points.

1. A lecturer can award bonus points for questions that are goal-oriented and lecture-related. Good questions earn a star, and the student finds an 8-digit code ("bonus token") for each star in their bonus archive. The tokens can be redeemed for bonus points by emailing the instructor. The lecturer or his moderators can validate the submitted bonus tokens with the awarded ones in their bonus archive.

1. Instructors and moderators can affirm, deny, answer, star, or ban questions to the moderation board. Questions on the moderation board can be released individually. Only room creators can delete questions, but only if they do not have a bonus star. All other users can only delete their own questions.

1. Every user can sort the question board according to the criteria "newest question first", "downward or upward by rating points" and "degree of controversy". The board can be searched and the questions can be filtered. The following filter criteria are available: bonus-awarded, conversations, bookmarked, answered, unanswered, question number, censored, and own questions. In addition, the question stream can be paused, i.e., new questions are only displayed if the user releases the question stream again.

1. Room creators and moderators can define categories ("tags") for questions in the room settings. The person asking the question can then tag their question with one of the predefined categories. Categorized questions can be filtered by clicking on the tag. Room creators and moderators can also tag questions afterwards.

1. Room creators and moderators have the option to enable all questions for anonymous commenting. The comments then appear as a conversation offset to the side below the respective question.

1. Each user can call up a message board where their own questions are listed as soon as they have received a reaction: for example, if they have been commented on, answered in the affirmative, denied, banned, published or deleted.

1. There is a presentation mode called "Question Focus" that allows each user to view the questions individually in full view. Also, new questions can be displayed automatically in the "Auto Focus" mode.

1. There is a navigation mode called "Question Radar". The radar locates questions based on keywords generated by an AI in real time. The larger and more central a keyword appears on the radar, the more numerous or significant the questions associated with it.

1. Any user can export all questions with their answers, comments, and tags. The room creator and moderators can also export the moderated questions. If bonuses have been awarded, the associated bonus codes are also in the export table.

1. Registered users can be informed about new questions and answers by mail. Weekday and time of the mail notification are adjustable.

1. The user interface meets the requirements for readability according to WCAG 2.1 AA. Appropriate display options are available for beamer presentation and for visually impaired persons. In particular, the font size of the questions can be scaled. In addition to the room code, a room can also be entered via an automatically generated direct link.

1. Any number of rooms can be created as guest or registered user. Only the rooms of registered users remain permanently. 180 days after the last use of a room it will be deleted automatically. Bonus tokens of unregistered participants are only stored in the browser cache. If the browser cache is deleted, the tokens are lost. Before leaving a session as an unregistered person, they will be asked to export their acquired tokens as a mail draft or save them to the clipboard.

1. Although an ordinary website, it behaves like an app from the App Store. It can be installed from the browser: "Add to Home". After that, it launches like a regular app. As a "Progressive Web App" (PWA), it runs on any smartphone, no matter what operating system, no matter what browser. So the audience will always be ready to use "frag.jetzt" on the spot and spontaneously.

## frag.jetzt development with docker

frag.jetzt consists of a variety of backend services. Starting them all individually or installing them on the computer is complex, which is why there is a docker compose solution for this.

### Prerequisite

The following software has to be installed on your computer:

1. GNU/Linux compliant operating system, for example:
    1. Debian based: Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, ...
    2. Arch based: Arch, Manjaro, ...
    3. Red Hat based: Red Hat, RHEL, Fedora, CentOS, ...
    4. ...
2. Docker
    1. [Installation Instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
    2. [Docker Reference](https://docs.docker.com/reference/)
3. Docker Compose
    1. [Installation Instructions](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
    2. [Docker Compose Reference](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/)

#### Prerequisite for other OS's

**We strongly recommend that you use a GNU/Linux compliant OS! Despite many optimizations, frag.jetzt doesn't run nearly as fast on Windows or MacOS as it does on a GNU/Linux OS!**

##### Windows

Turn off the conversion of line encodings in git.

```bash
git config --global core.autocrlf false
```

Follow the Instructions for windows described in the [Docker Orchestration repository](https://git.thm.de/arsnova/frag.jetzt-docker-orchestration).

##### MacOS

Install the GNU Core Utilities.

### Get the code base

Clone the frag-jetzt repository and the Docker Orchestration repository:

- [frag.jetzt](https://git.thm.de/arsnova/frag.jetzt)
- [Docker Orchestration](https://git.thm.de/arsnova/frag.jetzt-docker-orchestration)

### Start the Backend services

Follow the steps described in the [Docker Orchestration repository](https://git.thm.de/arsnova/frag.jetzt-docker-orchestration).

Use the `--no-frontend` option so that the frontend does not spin up in Docker Orchestration.

### Start the Frontend

The frag.jetzt frontend ships with an easy setup script: `.docker/setup.sh`. To run the setup script, make sure it is executable. If it is not, make it executable:

```bash
chmod u+x .docker/setup.sh
```

Now, run the setup script:

```bash
./.docker/setup.sh
```

You may now start the frontend. Use following commands:

```bash
# Start the app in foreground (not recommended)
docker-compose up

# Start the app in background
docker-compose up -d

# Show and follow the logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Shutdown app
docker-compose down

# Shutdown app and remove volumes
docker-compose down -v
```

## Access frag.jetzt

If you did not change any ports, the application is now available under [localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).

All emails from the system are intercepted and can be viewed in the Mailhog interface at [localhost:8025](http://localhost:8025/).

## Code style analysis

To run a local code style check with sonarqube, follow these steps:

1. switch into the analysis folder  
  `cd analysis`
2. start the sonarqube server  
  `docker-compose up -d sonarqube`
3. when sonarqube has started, you may run analysis whenever you want with  
  `docker-compose run --rm analysis`
