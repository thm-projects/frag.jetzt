    "add-moderators": "## Moderators \n\nGuest and permanent moderators have the same rights as the creator of the room. But they can't delete questions or the whole room. \n\nEveryone can be added as a **permanent moderator** with their **mail address** with which they registered at »frag.jetzt«. \n\nAn unregistered user can become a **guest moderator** by entering the room via **direct link** or 8-digit **access code**.",
    "bonus-archive": "## Bonus Archive \n\nAll questions that you have marked with a star in your rooms are listed here. You can use the list to check whether the bonus code that a participant sent you by mail is valid. \n\nTo find a code quickly, there is a search field. If the code is valid, you can display the corresponding question directly via a link.",
    "brainstorming": "## Brainstorming \n\nWhen creating a brainstorming session, moderators set the topic of the session and the maximum number of words and characters per contribution. If only one word is allowed as a contribution, an AI performs a morphological comparison of all contributions. Multiple entries are reliably detected despite different inflection and spelling of the words and displayed in an appropriate font size in a word cloud. \n\nEach entry in the word cloud can be voted on. To do this, move the mouse pointer over the entry and click on a voting icon in the associated pop-up window.",
    "close": "Close",
    "cloud-configuration": "## AI settings \n\nHere you can find an overview of all keywords and the blacklist of entries that you have banned from the word cloud. You can also customize the keyword extraction AI and configure the size and density of the word cloud.\n\nFirst, you define the origin of the keywords: whether the user's keywords and/or the keywords from the automatic extraction are taken as input for the word cloud.\n\nAfter defining the origin of the data, you can set the weighting of the metadata, which ultimately determines the size and centrality of a keyword.\n\nThe blacklist and profanity filter are a good way to remove keywords from the word cloud manually and, in some cases, automatically.\n\nWith some language expertise, you can grammatically restrict or extend the generation of the word cloud. For example, you can specify that only nouns that act as the grammatical subject of a sentence are displayed. The grammatical settings are language-specific.\n\nThe last setting concerns the display threshold for keywords in the word cloud. When a lot of questions and answers are analyzed, it is easy to lose track. If you increase the display threshold for keywords (minimum number of questions, questioners and up-votes with this keyword) or limit the time period in which the questions were asked or answered, then the size and density of the word cloud is also reduced. This way you can experimentally optimize the significance of the keywords. Have fun!",
    "deepl": "## Text optimization\n\nTo make your question as readable and understandable as possible, we have it translated into German and back into English using the translation program [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/translator).\n\nThe back translation is in almost all cases better than the original in terms of spelling, grammar, punctuation and language style. Back translation can be done in two ways: informally or formally.",
    "label": "Explain",
    "room-settings-overview": "## Room settings \n\nHere you can see all settings of the room at a glance. \n\nYou can also make changes later in the options menu of the room. \n\nBecause of the anonymity of the users and the potential abuse of the Q&A forum, we offer you restriction options with the first three buttons. Look at the hints in the tooltips of the buttons.",
    "spacy": "## Text analysis\n\nUsing NLP (Natural Language Processing) your question will be analyzed grammatically. The recognized nouns are put into their basic form, i.e. lemmatized, and suggested to you as keywords. For the text analysis we use the free NLP software [spaCy](https://spacy.io/). \n\nThe keywords can be used to filter the list of questions or to create a word cloud.",
    "topic-cloud": "## Question radar \n\n If you want to keep track of all questions, you need a kind of \"radar\". Our radar locates questions and answers by their keywords: The more questions and answers refer to a keyword, the larger and more central the keyword appears on the radar.\n\n The question radar serves you as a **navigator**: Clicking on a word will take you to the questions and answers related to that keyword. \n\n The keywords are determined in real time by means of a grammatical analysis of the nouns or were determined by the author. \n The calculation of the font size includes:\n\n* the difference between up- and down-votes, if positive,\n* the number of questions with this keyword,\n* the number of question creators with this keyword,\n* the role: room creator, moderator, or participant,\n* whether a question category was selected,\n* whether the keyword was generated or assigned,\n* whether the question was answered,\n* the controversiality of the question. \n\nYou can customize the visualization to your liking.  In the role of room creator or moderator, you can experiment with the parameters of the keyword generation to improve the **semantic selectivity**.",
    "user-bonus": "## Bonus \n\nThe teacher can mark »good« questions for a bonus. Your questions from all courses (rooms) that have received a star will be listed here.\n\nDepending on the agreement, you can email the code of the star to the teacher to redeem it for a bonus."
