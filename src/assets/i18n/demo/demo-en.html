  <p>
    Talks, lectures and since Corona also online seminars usually end with: »Any questions?«.
    And always nobody answers or the same ones always ask the questions.
    Hardly anyone in the lecture hall dares to answer,
    or the questions that one actually wanted to ask during the course of the lecture are forgotten.
    In the video conferencing system, you are not anonymous. The session may be recorded.
    The microphones are muted.
    The chat quickly becomes confusing; the teacher can hardly follow the comments and questions.
  </p>

 <p>
   If you want your lectures and online seminars to be reflected upon,
   you need a tool that allows you to ask questions anonymously and silently.
   Such an open source tool is available free of charge with »frag.jetzt«.
   Are there any concerns?
   Is the tool accessible, data protection compliant,
   immediately usable with any end device without training and without technical understanding?
   Three times yes.
 </p>

  <p>
    If I let »frag.jetzt« be used anonymously and thus without social control, do I not invite abuse?
    No, because the question list can be moderated live by an assistant:
    Only questions appropriate to the lecture remain on the list.
    In addition, you can automatically move all new questions to the moderator:
    They only become public when you or your moderator release them individually.
  </p>

  <p>
    But I cannot answer all questions in the last ten minutes of my lecture or in the online seminar.
    Sure. This is where the collective tool aspect comes into play:
    everyone in the audience can rate each question, in other words, vote up or down.
    You can answer the questions rated highest by the audience immediately,
    the others, if you wish, later in »frag.jetzt« or in the course forum of the learning platform.
    You can also use the tool before the meeting,
    to collect questions from the participants and make them available to each other for weighting.
    This involves the participants even before the meeting,
    allows you to ask for expectations and previous knowledge and helps you to adapt your presentation or seminar accordingly.

  What's so special about »frag.jetzt«?
</h2>
<p>
  What makes our backchannel tool different from »Mentimeter«, »Slido«, »Poll Everywhere« and many other commercial feedback apps?
  It's the result of many years of experience with audience response systems in classroom and online teaching.
  Besides an intuitive usability, proven in empirical UX studies with hundreds of students,
  didactic and motivational criteria were decisive for the conception and development of the app,

    <strong>Awarding a bonus for questions</strong><br><br>The teacher can award bonus points for good questions.
    Awarded questions receive a star and the student finds an 8-digit number code (»token«) for each star on the session
    account.
    The tokens can be redeemed for bonus points by sending an e-mail to the teacher.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Answering questions</strong><br><br>Teachers and moderators can affirm, deny and comment on questions or mark them as discussed.
    Of course, the symbols can also be used for other labelling purposes.
    They also serve as filter criteria to quickly find marked questions.
    That students cannot comment on questions is intentional:
    »frag.jetzt« should not be Facebook or Twitter.
    If we allowed it, the students would only be busy commenting on their fellow students' questions.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Categorizing questions</strong><br><br>The room creator can define categories (tags) for questions.
       The question poser can assign his or her question to one of the predefined categories.
       Categorized questions can be filtered by clicking on the tag.
       For example, tagging allows the moderator of a panel discussion to filter questions from the audience by topic or addressee:
       tag »Question to Mr. Biden«, tag »Question to Mr. Trump« …
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Analyzing questions with AI support</strong><br><br>

    Over the course of an online course,
    hundreds of questions can quickly accumulate in the back channel,
    making it difficult to keep track of them after the fact.
    This is where AI with NLP (Natural Language Processing) helps to keep track:
    The nouns in the texts are analyzed for their grammatical position in the sentence
    and suggested as keywords to the questioner for thematic classification.
  </p>
  <p>
    Well aware that the linguistic quality of an anonymous text is generally low
    in terms of spelling, grammar, punctuation and style,
    »frag.jetzt« sends the text to the online translation service
    <a class="info"
       href="https://deepl.com"
       target="_blank"
       rel="noreferrer">»DeepL«
      <span>Opens new window</span>
    </a>

    and translates it into a foreign language, for example German into English.
    The AI behind DeepL ignores just about any linguistic deficits.
    The subsequent back translation into the source language
    transforms a poorly written source text into a formally correct and easily readable generated text
    without distorting the content.
    The thus cleaned text is passed on to the NLP software
    <a class="info"
       href="https://spacy.io/"
       target="_blank"
       rel="noreferrer">»spaCy«
      <span>Opens new window</span>
    </a>

    in order to extract nouns by case as keywords from it.
    The result is impressive: We create a word cloud from the AI-generated keywords of all questions,
    which we aptly call »topic cloud« in »frag.jetzt«.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Presenting questions in a focused way</strong><br><br>For the discussion of the questions on the beamer,
    they can be presented individually in full view.
    Advancing to the next or previous question is conveniently done with the arrow keys.
    You can also activate the display in "kiosk mode":
    Then, incoming new questions are automatically shown in full view.
    Switching to the next question is delayed to allow reading.
    On the question list, constantly new questions or ratings can make reading and presenting difficult, as the positions of the questions change.
    With the pause icon the question stream can be frozen.
    However, new questions or ratings are still possible.
    If the presenter clicks on a question in the question list, it appears in full view.
    At the same time, the question flashes on the end devices of all participants to attract their attention.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Search, sort and filter questions</strong><br><br>
    The quick location of specific questions is made possible by search, sort and filter options.
    The full text search also includes the answers.
    Sorting is possible by time, rating and the degree of controversy.<br><br>

    To identify controversial questions, i.e.,
    questions where the positive and negative votes balance each other and have a value close to zero in the question list,
    we introduce an innovative sorting criterion: the degree of controversy or contradiction.
    First, we form the difference between positive and negative votes and subtract it from the total number of votes.
    What remains is the absolute number of controversial votes.
    We divide this value by the total number of votes to get the percentage.
    Finally, we stretch the percentage with an empirical term
    so that questions with very few controversial votes are not classified as more controversial than questions with many votes.
    A simple calculation with great power for question rounds with controversial topics.<br><br>

    The following filter criteria can be selected: Bonus-awarded, bookmarked, not bookmarked, answered, unanswered, and own questions.<br><br>
    By clicking on the tag icon of a question, all questions of this category are displayed.
    By clicking on the user icon of a question, all questions of this user will be displayed.
    This allows you to assess the distribution of questions among the question posers:
    How many people participate? Which questions does one and the same person ask?

<h2 tabindex="0">Activate students online</h2>

<p>
  Anyone who has held online seminars in a video conferencing system for 90 minutes
  knows what it means to speak against a »digital wall«:
  Talking without feedback with a tendency to talking to yourself.
  Whether the participants really listen, understand what they are hearing or are even present at all cannot be seen. Their cameras are switched off.
  Malte Persike explains how students can be activated with back-channel tools like »frag.jetzt« in spite of the wall:

<h2 tabindex="0">Mobile phone use in the lecture hall</h2>
<div tabindex="0">
  <p>
    The use of the smartphone during the lecture naturally entails a high risk of distraction.
    We have learned from our many years of experience with audience response systems in lecture halls,
    how to didactically approach the risk of distraction:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Mobile phone use during the lecture:</p>
      <p>An assistant moderates the question list on site or from a distance.
         10 minutes before the end of the lecture, the teacher answers 2-3 top questions on the beamer.
         <br><br>
         What if I don't have an assistant available?
         Follow Malte Persike's advice from the video above:
         Ask someone from the front row to take over this job.
         She or he won't say no.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Mobile phone use only during the break:</p>
      <p>The teacher announces the room code during the break and moderates the questions himself.
        After the break she answers 2-3 top questions.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>No mobile phone use during the lecture (A):</p>
      <p>The teacher creates a new room at the end of each lecture.
        Students can ask and rate questions at home.
        The question list is moderated by an assistant or the teacher himself.
        In the first 10 minutes of the next lecture the teacher answers 2-3 top questions.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>No mobile phone use during the lecture (B):</p>
      <p>The teacher creates a room for the entire duration of the course.
        An assistant moderates the question list during the semester.
        The teacher marks the relevant questions and deletes all others.
        The question list thus serves to reflect on the lecture contents and to prepare for the exam.</p>
