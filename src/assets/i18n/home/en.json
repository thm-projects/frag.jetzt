Back translation can be done in two ways: informally or formally.",

The recognized nouns are put into their basic form, i.e. lemmatized, and suggested to you as keywords. For the text analysis we use the free NLP software [spaCy] (https://spacy.io/). \n\nThe keywords can be used to filter the list of questions or to create a word cloud.",

These were determined by grammatical analysis of the nouns in the question text or explicitly assigned to the question by the author. \n\n The calculation of the font size includes:\n\n* the difference between up- and down-votes, if it is positive\n* the number of questions with this keyword\n* the number of questioners with this keyword.\n* the role of the questioner: room creator, moderator or participant \n* whether the questioner has selected a question category\n* whether the keyword was generated or assigned by the question poser\n* whether the question was answered by the room creator or a moderator\n* the controversy of the question \n\n The topic cloud serves as a **navigator** to all questions related to a selected keyword: If you click on a word in the cloud, you will get to the questions related to this keyword. \n\nThe room creator can customize the appearance of the topic cloud in the options according to his wishes. He can also experiment with the keyword generation parameters to optimize the **semantic selectivity**.",

    "bonus-archive": "## Bonus Archive \n\nAll questions that you have marked with a star in your rooms are listed here. You can use the list to check whether the token that a participant sent you by mail is valid. \n\nTo find a token quickly, there is a search field. If the token is valid, you can display the corresponding question directly via a link.",
    "brainstorming":  "## Brainstorming \n\nWhen creating a brainstorming session, the room creator or a moderator sets the topic of the brainstorming session and determines the maximum total number of words and characters per entry.\n\nEach entry in the word cloud can be voted on. To do this, hover over the entry and click on a voting icon in the associated pop-up window.\n\nIn the Q&A list, all brainstorming entries can be displayed with the corresponding filter. If the author has entered his name when creating the entry, it will be visible on the entry.",
