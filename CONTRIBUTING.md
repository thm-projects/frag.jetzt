## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have a [GitLab account](https://gitlab.arsnova.eu/).
2. Review existing issues or submit a new one for each task.
3. Provide clear descriptions for issues, including steps to reproduce for bugs.

## Making Changes

1. Create a topic branch based on the `staging` branch.
   - Use descriptive tags for your issue/branch/merge request.
   - Provide information about your work.
   - Tip: Use GitLab's "Create branch" feature from the issue page.
2. Make logical and atomic commits.
3. Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
4. Write tests for your changes when possible.
5. Run all tests to ensure nothing else is broken.

## Submitting Changes

1. Push your changes to your topic branch.
2. Ensure your branch is up-to-date with `staging`. Rebase if necessary.
3. Submit a merge request to the repository.
4. Verify your changes meet all [Definition of Done](DoD.md) criteria.
5. Provide detailed information about your changes.
6. Mark your merge request as "Ready for testing" when complete, or "Work in progress" with `[WIP]:` in the title if still ongoing.
7. The team will test your changes and mark it "Ready for Review" if acceptable.
8. The Scrum Master will review your code for style and compatibility.
9. If issues arise, don't panic! Address the change requests, and your merge request will remain open.

## Git Commit Messages

- Use present tense: "Add feature" not "Added feature"
- Use imperative mood: "Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to..."
- Limit the first line to 72 characters
- Reference issues and merge requests after the first line
